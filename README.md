## Hi there, I'm Sophie Lin!

- Junior at Wellesley College, studying Computer Science
- Software Engineer (Machine Learning + Full Stack) 

I’m passionate about building technologies that prioritize people -- secure, explainable, and designed to make a real difference. I’m especially interested in agentic AI, machine learning, full-stack development, and high-performance computing. In my free time, I love exploring ethical and explainable AI and creating AI applications in music.
